# ðŸ˜° aoe-lobbyrank

Show ELO ranking and other much needed statistics in AOE lobbies right from your browser.
LobbyRank leverages the AOE 2 Definitive Edition API to show the ranking of players joining your lobby.

This helps you to balance teams as well as keeping the game more entertaining by kicking high-level or low-level players before the game starts.

LobbyRank visualises the current ranking, wins, losses, average lobby rating, country, drops, streaks and more.
